        <p>By supervised training, the user is teaching the network to distinguish between two or more pick sets. At each pick location, a number of attribute values is collected.</p>
        <p>As an example, fault detection requires two picksets. The user needs to pick locations where a fault is present (pickset A), and locations where there aren't any faults (pickset B). This whole operation can serve two purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Efficiency/Automatization. You don't have the time to go through the entire set and pick each and every little fault.</li>
            <li value="2">Find "more than meets the eye". Subtle faults can be present without noticing it but the network picks them up anyway.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It will be clear that the interpreter needs to define attributes that are sensitive to fault characteristics. Therefore, you need to make picksets of positions that contain different objects ("yes, there is a fault here") and counter-examples ('no, there aren't any faults here'). Other examples include <i>Channel vs. Non-channel</i> or maybe three choices, e.g. <i>Channel deposits, Overbank deposits and Shale</i>. All in all, the very first requirement is that you can pick examples from the data set.</p>

        <p><i>Neural Network Training for the ChimneyCube</i>
        </p>
        <p>During application, the software extracts the same attributes at volumes or horizons and uses the same neural network to predict whether we have a type A or type B situation there. When displaying, you can choose between two network outputs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The probability that a certain position is a "type A" location</li>
            <li value="2">The type number (A=1, B=2 etc.).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At some locations, the network is more 'certain' than at other locations. You can get this ['confidence' by looking at the <i>probability</i> or at the <i>Confidence</i>.</p>
        <p>During training of the neural network, you can monitor whether the network can figure out, given the attributes you have defined, whether a location is more like the ones in set A than the ones in set B. If the network would predict that a position would be type A, but in fact it actually is picked by you in pickset B, then that is a <i>misclassification</i> of the network. The lower the number of misclassification, the better.</p>
