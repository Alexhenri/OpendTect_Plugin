        <p>2D Interpretation windows is somewhat identical to the conventional 3D window. The only difference is that you need to select the relevant 2D line in this window on which the interpretations would be made. Note that the slider (Top / Bottom) works individually for a selected line only.</p>
        <p>It is also supported to copy one line's interpretation to another line using the <i>Copy</i> button. If the interpretation has already been made on an intersecting line, you could copy that interpretation to another intersecting line. In this manner, you would keep the same number of systems tracts on the new intersection and the boundaries would be placed automatically. This will also avoid the mis-ties at the intersections.</p>
        <p>Save <i>All Surfaces</i> button will allow you to save the interpreted sequence stratigraphic surfaces as 2D horizons. The surfaces that you want to save are added on to the right list box using the arrows. The corresponding lines 2D lines on which the interpretation was made for the selected lines must also be selected by the user. The output name / colour should be mentioned prior to pressing the OK button.</p>
        <img src="../../resources/images/sequence_stratigraphic_interpretation_system/save_all_srfcs_main.png" class="image" />
        <p>Note that you could also save/rename/delete each surface individually by right clicking on the surface name in the graphical area. It will launch the pop-up menu with the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Rename:</b> It will rename the surface either at a user-defined manner or Auto-set. In the user-defined manner, the provide name would be used. If the name is set to Auto-set, it will automatically number the default surfaces according to the selected model.</li>
            <li value="2"><b>Save as surfaces:</b> It is used to save the surface as a 2D horizon. In the pop-up window, the corresponding lines are listed on which the surface has been interpreted. The line selection must be made by the user in the <i>Select 2D lines</i> list. The output name / colour should also be provided.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="../../resources/images/sequence_stratigraphic_interpretation_system/select_2d_lines.png" class="image" />
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Delete:</b> It will remove the selected boundary and would extend the lower interpreted systems tract up.</li>
            <li value="2"><b>Hide surface names:</b> This is used to hide the surface label.</li>
        </ul>
