---------
v6.4.3: February 18, 2019
* [F&F] Added options for hiding/displaying extracted skins and keeping
  selected skins irrespective of filtered range
* [F&F] Import facility for FaultSets
* [F&F] Possibility to extract more than one Fault from a FaultSet in one go
* [HC] Performance improvements for reading and displaying 2D HorizonCubes
* [HC] Some fixes and improvements in the 2D HorizonCube region and line
  correlation workflow
* [SSIS] Added possibility to show/hide 2nd order Interpretation in SSIS
* [WCP] Fix for viewing Wells only in Well Correlation Panel
* [[WCP] Fix for not reconizing Inline/Crossline/2D line positions
  (when launched from Tree scene) in Well Correlation Panel

v6.4.2: December 12, 2018
* [F&F] Improved GUI with option to filter the Fault skins based on Average
  Strike and Average Dip apart from Skin Size
* [HC] Fix for freezing issue while computing 2D HorizonCube with start
  position at 'Max thickness'
* [HC] Fix for not filling the significant gaps of 2D HorizonCube after adding
  more iterations
* [PetrelDirect] Support for surveys that have XY or Depth in Feet
  (Needs an update of Petrel plugin)
* [SynthRock] Fix for occasional crash while selecting wells input in the
  Synthrock-HC wizard

v6.4.1: November 26, 2018
* [F&F] Fix for TFL border like artefacts when input volume is irregular
* [F&F] Fix for Memory leak in Fault Planes Extraction(From Skins)
* [F&F] Fix for FaultSet's Histogram Display and Change Transparency
* [F&F] Fix for incorrect Fault Proximity attribute output
* [SSIS] Seismic data in a Wheeler scene is not interpolated by default 
* [SynthRock] Angle-stack computation in SynthRock is optimized

v6.4.0: October 15, 2018
* Faults & Fractures:
    - New algorithm for extracting Fault planes from Fault Likelihood cubes. It 
      first produces the best possible Fault skins which can be converted into
      individual Fault planes or FaultSets with several Fault planes in one go.
    - Introducing FaultSet containing several Fault planes that can be
      visualized and managed collectively.

* HorizonCube, SSIS, SynthRock:
    - HorizonCube events and SSIS interpretations based on HorizonCube can be
      used to perform structural/stratigraphic modelling to generate synthetic
      sections in the Profile module of SynthRock.
    - Provision for using available well logs and/or pseudo-1D models for
      modelling the rock properties within the packages bound by HorizonCube
      events or SSIS interpretations.
    - Availability of a multiviewer to visualize the results in one syncronized
      window: Seismic (along a 2D line or a 3D random line), Synthetic and the
      Layer Model (e.g. Acoustic Impedance, Velocity, Porosity...)
